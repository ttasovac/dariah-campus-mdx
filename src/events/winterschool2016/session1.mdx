### Abstract

Research data in SSH

The presentation will investigate the relationship between data and text in
different document types, in social sciences and humanities. It will introduce
different categories and types of research data, make the link with research
fields and methods, and add some comments about differences between SS&H and
STM. It will also question the future of the distinction between documents and
data, in the environment of content mining. Other issues will be addressed for
further discussion: sharing and reusage of data; impact and evaluation of data;
the link between document, data life cycle and the research process;
identification, curation and preservation; and the function of data in the new
context of open science. What is data? What is NOT data? What is functional and
dysfunctional in the field of data management and data publishing? May be that
at the end there are more open questions than answers.
